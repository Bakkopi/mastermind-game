# Mastermind Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic Mastermind game. The game generates a secret code made up of 4 colors, and the player's goal is to guess the code within a certain number of attempts. The game provides feedback after each attempt to help the player refine their guesses.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script using a compatible Python interpreter.
2. The program will prompt you to enter a username (up to 20 characters) for the leaderboard.
3. You will be given a set number of attempts to guess the secret code.
4. Enter a combination of 4 colors by typing the first letter of each color.
   - Red (R)
   - Yellow (Y)
   - Green (G)
   - Blue (B)
   - Violet (V)
   - Cyan (C)
5. After each attempt, you will receive feedback on the correctness of your guess.
6. Continue guessing until you either break the code or exhaust your attempts.

## Features

- Random generation of the secret code.
- Feedback on each attempt indicating the number of correct colors in the correct and wrong positions.
- User-friendly interface for input and output.
- Leaderboard to track the number of attempts taken by different players to break the code.
- Supports replayability with the option to start a new game.
